# Landing Page

This Landing Page is a simple webpage project included as part of The Odin Project curriculum.
Lesson found in the Foundations Course. Reference design images were provided for design to duplicate as well as font and colors used. Flexibility was encouraged while sticking to the basic design layout and fonts/colors of specified sections. 

The project incorporates html and css to demonstrate basic coding and practive Flexbox layout.
As this is part of a coding foundations course, redundancy, lack of simplified practices, and simple errors within the code is likely.
